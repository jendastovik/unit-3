## Part B
A 9-bit processor can represent 2^9 or 512 different values. In terms of colors, this means it can represent 512 different color variations. The processor can represent 512 different colors because each bit can be either 0 or 1, which means it can represent 2 different values. Since there are 9 bits, the total number of different values that can be represented is 2^9 or 512.
