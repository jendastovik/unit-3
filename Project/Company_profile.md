## Our focuc on sustainability
The electronics industry's reliance on raw materials from undeveloped countries, often accompanied by human rights violations, is an alarming and unsustainable practice. In pursuit of cost-effectiveness, companies source minerals like cobalt and rare earth elements from regions marked by lax regulations and widespread poverty. Exploitative mining practices, including child labor and hazardous conditions, persist, while environmental degradation compounds the issues. This cycle of exploitation perpetuates poverty and social instability. Urgent action is required, involving responsible sourcing, transparent supply chains, and stringent regulations. Consumers, manufacturers, and governments must collaborate to break this unethical cycle, fostering a more sustainable and socially conscious electronics industry.
That is why we want to make sure that our supply line is safe and our product is not stained with blood and tears.
